# Python-Project-Telecom-Customer-Churn-Data-Analysis

I done Telecom Customer Churn Analysis - A Python-based data analysis project using an Excel dataset to examine telecom customer churn trends. It involves data preprocessing, cleaning, visualization, and churn pattern analysis to enhance customer retention strategies.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn in a telecom company to understand factors influencing customer retention and churn. By identifying trends, patterns, and risk factors, the company can implement strategies to reduce churn and improve customer loyalty.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) & Questions

To evaluate customer churn, we analyze the following key aspects:

•	Churn Rate: What percentage of customers have left the service?
•	Demographic Influence: How do gender and senior citizen status impact churn?
•	Service-Based Churn: Which services (internet, phone, streaming, etc.) contribute to higher churn?
•	Contract Type & Retention: Which contract types have the highest and lowest churn rates?
•	Monthly Charges vs. Churn: Do higher monthly charges lead to more churn?
•	Tenure & Customer Loyalty: How does customer tenure influence churn probability?
•	Churn Prediction & Mitigation: What factors can help predict and prevent churn?

##Process of Data Analysis

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
•	Handle missing values in Total Charges and ensure accurate data representation.
•	Convert categorical data into numerical formats where necessary.
•	Remove duplicates and standardize data types for consistency.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	Calculate churn rates across different customer groups.
•	Analyze service usage patterns and their impact on churn.
•	Identify customer segments with high churn rates (e.g., contract types, monthly charges).
•	Compute churn percentages for various demographic groups.

3. Visualization & Insights:
•	Use bar charts and pie charts to display churn distribution.
•	Create line and scatter plots to analyze tenure vs. monthly charges.
•	Generate heatmaps to identify correlations between services and churn.
•	Segment customers into different churn risk categories for targeted retention efforts.

##Project Insights (Key Findings)

•	Overall Churn Rate: 
o	26.5% of total customers have churned.

•	Demographic Influence: 
o	Senior citizens have a significantly higher churn rate (45.1%) compared to non-senior customers (22.3%).

•	Service-Based Churn: 
o	Customers with internet-only plans have a higher churn rate compared to bundled service users.

•	Contract Type & Retention: 
o	Month-to-month contract customers exhibit the highest churn (42.5%), while two-year contract holders have the lowest churn (3.9%).

•	Pricing Impact: 
o	Customers paying over $70/month churn at a higher rate (32.8%).

•	Customer Tenure Influence: 
o	Customers with a tenure of less than 12 months have the highest churn (51.6%), while long-term customers (>36 months) have a much lower churn rate (8.2%).

##Final Conclusion & Recommendations

•	Enhance New Customer Retention: 
o	Provide better onboarding experiences and incentives for customers with low tenure.

•	Encourage Long-Term Commitments: 
o	Month-to-month contracts see high churn. Offer discounts on annual contracts to increase retention.

•	Adjust Pricing Strategies: 
o	Flexible pricing plans and customized service bundles can help retain high-churn segments.

•	Improve Senior Citizen Retention: 
o	Develop senior-friendly plans and support services to lower churn among this group.

•	Leverage Service Bundles: 
o	Customers using multiple services (internet + phone + TV) churn less. Promote bundled offerings to reduce attrition.

By implementing these recommendations, the telecom company can significantly reduce churn, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance revenue growth.
