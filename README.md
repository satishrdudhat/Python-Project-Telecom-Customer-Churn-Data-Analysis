## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) & Questions

To evaluate customer churn, we analyze the following key aspects:
•	Churn Rate: What percentage of customers have left the service?
•	Demographic Influence: How do gender and senior citizen status impact churn?
•	Service-Based Churn: Which services (internet, phone, streaming, etc.) contribute to higher churn?
•	Contract Type & Retention: Which contract types have the highest and lowest churn rates?
•	Monthly Charges vs. Churn: Do higher monthly charges lead to more churn?
•	Tenure & Customer Loyalty: How does customer tenure influence churn probability?
•	Churn Prediction & Mitigation: What factors can help predict and prevent churn?
